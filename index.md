## About our Research

We are committed to developing __autonomous AI systems__ that can __continually learn__ and __adapt__ to __dynamic environments__. We are working on __hierarchical__ and __recurrent neural architectures__, along with corresponding __biologically plausible learning methods__, to facilitate __flexible__, __efficient__, and __scalable learning__ amidst __high-throughput sensory data streams__. One of our primary objectives is to __optimize efficiency__, ensuring that these systems can __function effectively despite resource constraints__ such as limited energy supply, memory, and computational power. It is our goal to contribute to __greening AI__, complementing big data-driven learning approaches with compact, efficient, and more __sustainable solutions__. On a higher level, we aim at fostering interdisciplinary research linking machine learning, cognitive science, and robotics to drive innovative progress.
