## Bio

I am a PhD student at the [Institute for Robotics and Cognitive Systems](https://www.rob.uni-luebeck.de/institut) at the [University of Lübeck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de), Germany, and a member of the Adaptive AI research group since January 2024. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science in 2021 at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) and obtained my Master's degree in the same major in 2023. Currently, she is working at Mercedes-Benz as a PhD student.

My recearch interest lies in how to make spiking neural networks learn more efficiently. My current research include resonate-and-fire spiking neuron models and their application to larger datasets, as well as online learning in spiking neural networks.
