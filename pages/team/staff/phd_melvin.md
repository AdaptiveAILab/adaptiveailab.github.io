## Bio
 
Melvin Ciurletti is a PhD student at the [Eberhard Karls University in Tübingen](), where he joined the [Neuro-Cognitive Modeling]() group under [Prof. Dr. Martin Butz](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/cognitive-modeling/staff/martin-butz/) in 2021 with [Prof. Dr. Sebastian Otte](https://adaptiveailab.github.io/team/sebastian) as his supervisor. Following Prof. Otte’s appointment at the [University of Lübeck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de), Melvin also became a member of the Adaptive AI research group. His research focuses on simulating complex temporal dynamics with Graph Neural Networks. As a part of the [KI-LaSt Project](https://www.rwth-innovation.de/de/aktuelles/alle-neuigkeiten/aktuelle-detailseiten/bmwi-foerderprojekt-ki-last), these models are applied to predict mechanical responses of meta-materials.
