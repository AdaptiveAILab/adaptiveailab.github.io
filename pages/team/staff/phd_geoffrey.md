## Bio

I am currently pursuing an industry-based PhD at Mercedes-Benz in Germany, focusing my research on advancing the robustness of neuromorphic algorithms. I am also a PhD student at the University of Lübeck, affiliated with the Institute for Robotics and Cognitive Systems and a member of the Adaptive AI research group. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree from the University of British Columbia in 2019, followed by a Master’s degree in Quantitative Data Science Methods form the University of Tübingen in 2021.
