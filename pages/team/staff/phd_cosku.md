## Bio

Coşku Can Horuz completed his Bachelor's degree in psychology at the University of Istanbul. Afterwards, Coşku worked at a private clinic for three years, working with pre- and elementary school children as a psychological counselor using the [PASS theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PASS_theory_of_intelligence). He continued his academic journey in the Cognitive Science study program at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/) in order to understand the brain deeper. There, he was caught in algorithms' charm and changed his direction towards computer science & artificial intelligence. Since October 2023 he is a PhD student at the [Institute for Robotics and Cognitive Systems](https://www.rob.uni-luebeck.de/institut) at the [University of Lübeck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de), Germany, and a member of the Adaptive AI research group.

His research interests almost always include a time dimension. More concretely, he is studying about machine learning models that are recurrent in their essence such as recurrent neural networks and state space models.
